#1 consider making the horozontal scrolling for the whole board, not per row

#2 run a whole IBM carbon, WCAG AAA, and Nielsen normal 10 heuristics for UX audit based on screenshots etc

#3 removed top status bar and put BPM as a button with settings, talk, next etc (maybe frees up space for another row of track, which should remain determined by the liquid layout)

#4 ensure everything is done in a way that maintains the computationally efficient, well documented, and modular approach that adheres to IBM carbon, WCAG AAA, and Nielsen normal 10 heuristics for UX. build this into the persistent spec for dev plans

#5 refactor the codebase to be more modular and maintainable and efficient for old tablet devices

#6 appdesign for minimum res of 1024x768 (ipad5 in landscape). upper expected limit is 2560x1440 (ipad pro 12.9). should break gracefully outside of those limits. include warning pop up when res is too low
