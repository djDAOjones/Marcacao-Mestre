## pause button should be global pause, pausing all tracks (with a 0.5s fade down, and 0.5s fade up when resumed after rewinding 1s)

## remove quantisation button and mix durations, just have a single toggle between "mix" which is a 2 bar quantised transition with crossfade, and "cut" which is non-quantised and a 50ms fade just to avoid harsh cut.

### there should be a "next" button to initiate the next cued song transition now
